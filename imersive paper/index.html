        <h2>I. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          The business industry encompasses a wide range of optimization problems, including the classical 0/1 knapsack problem, stock trend prediction [<a href="#ref_2">2</a>], wireless sensor network deployment [<a href="#ref_4">4</a>], and the traveling salesman problem (TSP). These problems often involve combinatorial decision-making, requiring the selection or exclusion of certain options. Additionally, some problems, such as the TSP, focus not only on which elements to select but also on determining their optimal order — for instance, deciding the sequence in which cities should be visited. Regardless of the specific problem type, the overarching objective is to minimize costs while maximizing overall benefits.

          Metaheuristic algorithms are commonly utilized to handle these complex real-world applications. They may solve non-specific issues through some modification of encoding and achieve a near-optimal solution in a finite amount of time. Most metaheuristic algorithms are population- and iterative-based, and the solution gets better with the evolved process in iterations with efficient and effective searchability, such as the genetic algorithm (GA)[<a href="#ref_6">6</a>], particle swarm optimization (PSO)[<a href="#ref_7">7</a>], ant colony optimization (ACO)[<a href="#ref_8">8</a>], estimation of the distribution algorithm (EDA)[<a href="#ref_9">9</a>], quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm (QEA)[<a href="#ref_10">10</a>], and quantum-inspired tabu search algorithm (QTS)[<a href="#ref_11">11</a>]. Various optimization problem-solving techniques have their own unique characteristics. Typically, the optimization search process of metaheuristic algorithms used to solve these problems is treated as a black box.

        <p>
          In recent years, the emerging topic of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) [<a href="#ref_12">12</a>], [<a href="#ref_13">13</a>], [<a href="#ref_14">14</a>] has been highly-valued. Users expect to clearly analyze the solving process to comprehend the efficacy and efficiency of optimization techniques. Therefore, the primary objective of XAI is to understand and interpret how the optimization techniques make decisions and derive the result, and then to increase the transparency of the optimization process. When analyzing the optimization process in solution space and how populations vary, users frequently output text information on the command line, log file, and Excel (<a href="#Cmd_text_log_file">Figure 1</a> and <a href="#Excel_text_log_file">Figure 2</a>) to improve the interpretability of the metaheuristics executing inner process. The expected observed goals are as follows: investigate and discover more details from the text including the algorithms' properties, patterns of movement, relationships between variables, and optimized trends among solutions. However, a large amount of information in a text lowers the perception of analyzing detail and makes it difficult to concentrate, which can lead to the omission of important pieces of information. Furthermore, the unorganized and messy information makes users hardly do the detailed analysis.
        </p>

        <p>
          Visualization is an important process to make users gain insight into data from another perspective and comprehend the results more effectively. As the saying goes, “A picture is worth a thousand words.” Graphic representation constitutes one of the basic sign systems conceived by the human mind [<a href="#ref_15">15</a>]. A picture can convey more than multiple ideas or a detailed text explanation. Therefore, this study presents an interface tool for the combinatorial optimization problem and evolutionary algorithm that is simpler to analyze the inner process of the optimization technique in a more visually interesting manner. To assist users in analyzing the process of metaheuristic algorithms and achieving the expected observed goals, this study proposes an innovative visualization tool for combinatorial optimization problems, Evo-Panel 2.0. Aside from visualizing a static picture, a video tells information more strongly than a still picture. Therefore, Evo-Panel 2.0 is designed with a dynamic interface, which can intuitively and vividly present the detailed process of an optimization algorithm through interactive animation. Most importantly, Evo-Panel 2.0 can visualize the optimized process of metaheuristics. The target of Evo-Panel 2.0 is to help users straightforwardly observe the solving process of the combinatorial problem.
        </p>

        <p>
          Depending on the various properties of a combinatorial optimization problem, Evo-Panel 2.0 provides three different interfaces to visualize the combinatorial optimization problem, including general, deployment, and permutation-based combination optimization interfaces. The first is the general combinatorial optimization interface, which is used for general combinatorial optimization problems that have no sequential 
          relation between each item, such as the 0/1 knapsack problem and stock selection problem. The second is for the deployment combinatorial optimization problem, which needs to accommodate the requirement of the map's requirement and minimize the sensor quantity and cost. The final is the permutation-based combinatorial optimization problem, in which each location has a sequential correlation and needs to minimize the path cost. In this problem, the solution is described by a permutation of n integers, such as TSP and minimum spanning tree that both need to minimize the path. Due to the characteristics of combinatorial optimization problems, the stochastic mechanism based on probability is frequently employed. Thus, in addition to the exact solution demonstration, Evo-Panel 2.0 offers the visualization of the probabilistic model's variation status, allowing users to acknowledge more detailed information easily and applicable to various metaheuristics. Evo-Panel 2.0 provides diverse and flexible visualization features and interfaces for different metaheuristics and different combinatorial optimization problems. This study aims to provide researchers with a useful visualization tool for analyzing the optimization technique, enhancing the interpretability of the optimized inner process, and assisting users in validating the design concept and program process consistency. The major contributions of Evo-Panel 2.0 are listed below.

        <h2>II. Optimization Problems</h2>
        <h3>0/1 Knapsack Problem</h3>
        <p>
          To illustrate, we utilize the 0/1 knapsack problem as a benchmark case study. In this problem, the notation '1' represents selection, and '0' signifies non-selection. To maximize the total value, researchers attempt to find a set of items while adhering to a weight constraint. In essence, the knapsack aims to carry items that possess a favorable cost-to-performance ratio, all the while complying with weight restrictions. In order to facilitate comprehension, we have simplified the 0/1 knapsack problem. The items in this 0/1 knapsack problem are divided into ten types, and each type has ten items. The weights of the item types are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10; the values of the item types are 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15, which are the weights plus 5. If the problem’s knapsack weight is large or small, it is easy to take all the items or remove all the items. Hence, we limit the weight constraint to half (275) of the total weight (550), so the problem becomes a non-trivial solution. Besides, the optimal solution (value) for this problem is 620, and the cost-performance (CP) value from high to low is from lowest weight to highest weight. For this kind of general combinatorial optimization problem, Evo-Panel 2.0 provides two models: general and probability models, to visualize the problem-solving process of metaheuristics.

        <h3>Placement Optimization and Detection Probability Calculation</h3>
        <p>
          The deployment optimization problem, also referred to as the wireless sensor network (WSN) problem, has applications in various fields, such as home automation, traffic monitoring and control, remote robotic surgery in medicine, industrial machine surveillance, and environmental fire detection. It represents a specific and critical challenge within the domain of combinatorial optimization. The deployment optimization problem's solution space is a two-dimensional map in which the problem needs to use the sensor as little as possible while satisfying the limited detection probability at each position (threshold). In this paper, a map is composed of a two-dimensional grid ($g_{ij}$). If the size of the map is $m*n$, then its width is $m$ and its length is $n$. Each grid point can only accommodate one sensor (<i>S</i>) at most. After placing the sensor, the detection probability is calculated based on the related-distance probabilistic detection model  [<a href="#ref_36">36</a>]. The detection probability ($P_{g_{ij}}^{S_{xy}}$) decreases with increasing distance from the sensor ($S_{xy}$). The detecting model has a confident and maximum radius convergence circle ($R_{cof}$ and $R_{max}$) as shown in <a href="#Deploy_schematic_diagram">Figure 8</a>.

          $R_{cof}$ is smaller than $R_{max}$. The confident radius convergence circle is the range of the sensor that must be detected, while the maximum radius convergence circle is the range of the sensor that can be detected, with signal strength decreasing with increasing distance. The detection probability calculation is separated into three situations (Equation 1):

          If Euclidean distance between the sensors and the grid point ($‖S_{xy} g_{ij}‖$) is in the confident circle, the sensor must be detected; hence, the chance of detection is 1. When the $‖S_{xy} g_{ij}‖$ is beyond the maximum circle, which indicates that it is outside the sensing radius, the chance of detection is 0. If the distance between the sensors and the grid point falls within the maximum circle but not the confident circle, the detection probability is equal to the reciprocal of ($‖S_{xy} g_{ij}‖$). Here, if the grid point is detected by more than two sensors, Equation 2:

          Within the domain of business, there are a multitude of optimization challenges that require resolution. Prior to resolving optimization challenges specific to the industry, researchers typically evaluate optimization algorithms using benchmark functions. Enhancing the efficacy of an optimization algorithm on benchmark functions increases the probability that it will successfully tackle optimization functions that are specific to a given industry. In this section, we use three benchmark problems to introduce how the system works on the three interfaces, including GA and QTS solving the 0/1 knapsack problem in the general combinatorial optimization interface, Entanglement-QTS [<a href="#ref_35">35</a>] solving the deployment optimization problem in the deployment combinatorial optimization interface, and ACO solving TSP in the permutation/linear combinatorial optimization interface.

        <h3>General Combinatorial Optimization Interface</h3>

        <p>
          In the general combinatorial optimization interface (general interface), all kinds of chosen or not combinatorial optimization problems can be displayed through this interface. Evo-Panel 2.0 can show the fitness, all item combinations in each generation, and items' detailed information so that users can check if the metaheuristic matches their thoughts or problems' constraints.

          The default general model would draw out the combinations of each generation. <a href="#Binary_beginning">Figure 3a</a> is the beginning display after loading a log file. The interface has three parts: the top displays file information, the middle illustrates the change process of metaheuristics as a video, and the bottom is the media player. First, on top of Evo-Panel 2.0 in <a href="#Binary_beginning">Figure 3a</a>, the gray area in the green box displays some function buttons and details information about the fitness on the mouse position, global best fitness, and file name. The function buttons in the top right corner can record videos, take pictures, load a file, save the file, and compare different metaheuristics. Second, in the central section (<a href="#Binary_beginning">Figure 3b</a>), this interface offers a comprehensive depiction of the metaheuristic algorithm's progression, showcasing each population, combination (highlighted within the blue box), and corresponding fitness arranged from left to right. The generation bar situated beneath the central interface facilitates the visualization of the ongoing iteration during the process display. Third, the bottom area in the orange box (<a href="#Binary_beginning">Figure 3c</a>) has control buttons, which can control the system by showing the combination of what users want. The functions from left to right are reset, start/pause, fast forward, slow down, speed, zoom in to see the whole combinations in each iteration, detail information, probability model, convergence curves, and go to a specified generation.
        </p>

        <p>
          <a href="#Binary_General_GA01">Figure 4a</a> illustrates the GA's solution to the 0/1 knapsack problem using a combination composed of black (representing bit 1) and white (representing bit 0) rectangles, allowing users to easily discern selected items. The black-and-white row in <a href="#Binary_General_GA01">Figure 4a</a> is the first generation's best (population best) combination, and the global best combination found thus far (global best, GB) is represented in the red-and-white row. On the right side of the green frame is the fitness of each row (generation). For the convenience of observing the change between before and current generations' best combinations, the combination is updated generation by generation.  As the iteration increases, the system displays more combinations, and the current generation's best combination (black-and-white row) gradually decreases (from <a href="#Binary_General_GA01">Figure 4a</a> $\sim$ <a href="#Binary_General_GA01">Figure 4c</a>). In the beginning (<a href="#Binary_General_GA01">Figure 4a</a>), the first generation's combination is the same as the global best combination. Next, the past generation's best combination turns into the gray-and-white row and fills up the blue box gradually (<a href="#Binary_General_GA01">Figure 4b</a> to <a href="#Binary_General_GA01">Figure 4c</a>). The newest and best combinations are always at the bottom, and they are adjacent to each other for the convenience of comparison. Meanwhile, in <a href="#Binary_General_GA01">Figure 4c</a>, the past generation's best combination turns gray can make the difference from the current generation's best combination. Moreover, the $10^{th}$ generation's best combination (fitness) in <a href="#Binary_General_GA01">Figure 4b</a> is not better than GB, so GB doesn't change in this generation. In addition, until the combination is full of the interface, the system scrolls up to keep the combination within $19$ generations. <a href="#Binary_General_GA01">Figure 4c</a> shows the generation from $2^{st}$ to $20^{th}$ generation, and the GB is the best combination with the first $20^{th}$ generation.
        </p>

        <p>
          In order to efficiently utilize Evo-Panel 2.0, well-designed control buttons are indispensable. Users have the option to modify the generation using either the generation bar or the "go to" function. By utilizing the "go to" feature to navigate to a specific generation, users can easily navigate to specific generations to observe the solving process. According to the user's needs, they can press “pause/start” whenever they want, and they can fast forward or slow down the animation to adjust the speed that they need for viewing. Beyond observing the item combinations in each solution, the meanings conveyed by different solutions vary. The button “detailed information” in <a href="#Binary_General_GA01">Figure 4d</a> can show detailed information in which the user can input any desired information to assist metaheuristic analysis, such as the knapsack number and weight. In this scenario, the knapsack number and weight can help users check if there are any illegal combinations. For a specific iteration, Evo-Panel 2.0 can also “zoom in” to see the current combination of a generation, as shown in <a href="#Binary_General_GA01_20th_zoomin">Figure 5</a>. The red-and-white row is the best combination (population best) in the current generation (the $20^{th}$ generation), and the blue-and-white row is the worst combination (population worst) in this generation.
        </p>

        <p>
          The characteristic of the probability-based metaheuristic is that it uses probability to determine if the bit is chosen or not. Based on the probability characteristic, we proposed the probability model for analyzing the EC that has a probability matrix, such as QEA, EDA, and QTS. In order to make the probability change intuitively observable through color, the probability model uses the heatmap method, which uses a red-to-blue rainbow hue to present the bit's probability from 1 to 0 (<a href="#QTS01">Figure 6a</a>).
        </p>

        <p>
          An EC called QTS uses probability to measure whether or not to choose the bit. Here, we use QTS to solve the 0/1 knapsack problem as an example. At the beginning of QTS's evolution process, the probability of every bit is set to half (0.5), so the display screen is almost green. The chance of being chosen and not chosen is the same, so items are randomly chosen. As the number of iterations increases (from <a href="#QTS01">Figure 6a</a> $\sim$ <a href="#QTS01">Figure 6d</a>), the color gradually turns from green to yellow, orange, and red on the left side screen. This means that the chosen probability gradually increases, which is because the knapsack's cost-performance ratio is higher the farther to the left. On the other side, the color changes from green to darker green, light blue, and dark blue. By progressively decreasing the probability of being selected, QTS gradually eliminates the knapsack of the low cost-performance ratio on the right side. Through the change in color, we can clearly and intuitively identify the change in probability. In addition, the system provides “detailed information” for users to see each bit's probability (<a href="#QTS01">Figure 6e</a>) if users want to check the exact number of probabilities. Clicking on the bit can see more information to analyze more precisely, including the bit's number, chosen or not, and probability.
        </p>

        <p>
          When QTS ends (<a href="#QTS01">Figure 6f</a>), we can see that the left side screen is full of red color and the blue color is almost on the right side. There are a few blue columns in the red area. From a different perspective, the global best (GB) in <a href="#QTS01">Figure 6f</a> and the combinations in <a href="#QTS01">Figure 6g</a>, three columns (bits) that point by the arrow are not chosen. To find the best solution to this problem, the algorithm discards items with a high cost-performance ratio and picks the items with a lower cost-performance ratio. This is because the 0/1 knapsack problem's knapsack has entanglement (dependency) between each item under some constraints. That is why the 0/1 knapsack problem is an NP-complete problem and why it is interesting. In addition, in this 0/1 knapsack problem, the best combination is more than one. During the analysis in <a href="#QTS01">Figure 6h</a>, we can see that the algorithm finds a different global best solution.

          For analyzing metaheuristics, users need to produce an <em>epin</em> file and load it into Evo-Panel 2.0. An <em>epin</em> file is a text file with a specific format that can be produced from any computer language that users use for metaheuristics. Using the <em>epin</em> file, users are not required to learn a new programming language. They can effortlessly generate the analysis file, allowing them to dedicate more time to studying and analyzing the metaheuristic.

        <h3>Deployment Optimization Interface</h3>

        <h3>1.Function Introduction</h3>

        <p>
          Deployment problems need a comprehensive view of the solution space because each position affects its neighborhood. The whole map of the solution space in Evo-Panel 2.0's deployment interface can help users observe the effect of the sensor on the surrounding position through the color change.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the deployment combinatorial optimization interface as shown in <a href="#Deploy_example">Figure 8b</a>, the map size is dependent on the user's setting or the problem's constraint. One grid point denotes one place. The black color represents the sensor, while the red-to-blue rainbow hue indicates the system-calculated sensor detection probability from 1 to 0. For ease of presentation, we set $R_{cof}=1$, $R_{max}=5$, where The detectable range is a circular area. In <a href="#Deploy_example">Figure 8b</a>, the map size is 9$\times$9, and a sensor is placed at the center of the map. The probability of detection ($P_{g_{ij}}^{S_{xy}}$) increases as the grid point is closer to the sensor. Conversely, it decreases as the distance from the sensor increases. When a grid point falls within the detection range of multiple sensors, as demonstrated by the center grid in <a href="#Deploy_example">Figure 8c</a>, its probability of detection increases according to Equation 2 (the probability increase from 0.333 to 0.556). The intriguing aispect of the deployment optimzation problem lies in strategically positioning the minimum number of sensors to ensure mutual reinforcement, thereby enabling all grid points on the map to achieve a probability higher than the specified threshold.

              Evo-Panel 2.0: Example of Deployment Optimization for Sensor Placement.

        </div>

        <p>
          As the map size increases in the deployment optimization problem, achieving the threshold for each grid point relies more heavily on the mutual support between sensors. For example, <a href="#Deploy_example">Figure 8d</a> demonstrates maps of varying sizes, including 5$\times$5, 10$\times$10, and 20$\times$20 grids. Each grid point is assigned a uniform threshold of 0.3. If a grid point fails to meet this threshold, it is marked with a red slash. Additionally, the “Map Check” feature displays the proportion of grid points that satisfy the threshold, calculated as the number of grid points meeting the threshold divided by the total number of grid points.
        </p>

        <p>
          Building on the insights from <a href="#Deploy_example">Figure 8d</a>, we analyze the sensor requirements for maps of different sizes to ensure all grid points meet the threshold. In a 5$\times$5 map, a single sensor is sufficient to satisfy the threshold for all positions. When the map size is doubled to 10$\times$10, at least four sensors are required to achieve the same threshold satisfaction. For a 20$\times$20 map, achieving the threshold for each grid point increasingly depends on the mutual support between sensors, as overlapping detection areas allow for redundancy reduction. While 16 sensors are initially required to satisfy the threshold for all positions, the optimization process leverages sensor overlap to reduce this number. Consequently, only 12 sensors are needed to ensure all grid points meet the threshold, demonstrating the efficiency of the deployment optimization strategy.
        </p>

        <p>
          Expanding the scope of the analysis, we explore the deployment optimization problem on a larger 50$\times$50 map, where the complexity increases exponentially with the map size. Unlike smaller maps, where sensor placement can be relatively straightforward, larger maps require metaheuristic algorithms to efficiently navigate the vast solution space. Evo-Panel 2.0 serves as a critical tool in addressing this challenge, providing both algorithmic support and user-driven customization for optimized sensor deployment.

        <p>
          As illustrated in <a href="#Deploy_example_50x50">Figure 9</a>, the Entanglement-QTS [<a href="#ref_35">35</a>] algorithm demonstrates its iterative optimization process over three stages. Initially (<a href="#Deploy_example_50x50">Figure 9a</a>), sensors are placed randomly, leading to significant overlap in detection areas. In the middle stages (<a href="#Deploy_example_50x50">Figure 9b</a>), the algorithm refines the placement by reducing redundancies, transforming excessive detection regions from red to yellow and green. By the final stage (<a href="#Deploy_example_50x50">Figure 9c</a>), an optimized solution emerges, requiring only 62 sensors to meet the detection threshold for all grid points.
        </p>

        <p>
          Beyond visualizing the algorithm's optimization process, Evo-Panel 2.0 empowers users to directly interact with the solution space. Users can manually adjust sensor placements, refining the algorithm's results and exploring alternative configurations to further improve efficiency. This interactive feature bridges the gap between automated computation and human intuition, enabling more flexible and practical deployment strategies. By integrating algorithm-driven insights with user-defined adjustments, Evo-Panel 2.0 delivers a powerful tool for solving large-scale deployment problems with precision and adaptability.

            <strong>Figure 9:</strong> An illustration of a deployment problem in Evo-Panel 2.0. (a) In the early stage of the Entanglement-QTS search, this map is almost red due to the sensor's high density and extensive overlap. (b) In the middle stage, the number of sensors decreases, and some positions display a green color detection probability. (c) At the end of Entanglement-QTS, Evo-Panel 2.0 shows that the entire color of all positions is mostly green, indicating that Entanglement-QTS reduces the cost of the sensor and finds an optimal solution for 62 sensors. (d) Evo-Panel 2.0 shows a demonstration of the connectivity of sensors within a distance of five. (e) Utilizing Evo-Panel 2.0, users have the capacity to manually refine the algorithm's optimal solution. By removing a sensor within the white box, a successful reduction in sensor count is achieved while maintaining adherence to the constraints. (f) Observing <a href="#Deploy_example_50x50">Figure 9f</a>, we identified overcrowding in the black box, prompting the removal of three sensors, resulting in an incomplete map check. (g) Afterward, two sensors were placed within the black box to fulfill the threshold requirement across the entire map, marking the map check status as "complete" once more. Evo-Panel 2.0 enabled users to save data with the final optimized result.

        <p>
          With the help of Evo-Panel 2.0, researchers can observe the sensor distribution, whether any regions are too dense, and how the detection probability superposition occurs. Moreover, we could see if this problem has a better solution and then use the interactive system to quickly find a solution that is better than the metaheuristic. Through the interactive system, researchers could add or remove the sensor to adjust the result, therefore obtaining a better solution. In <a href="#Deploy_example_50x50">Figure 9f</a>, we discovered that the bottom left corner is somewhat dense. Therefore, we removed one sensor from the bottom left corner (white box), reducing the total number of sensors from 62 to 61. Next, we discovered that the middle black box’s sensor could also decrease. Therefore, we remove three sensors (<a href="#Deploy_example_50x50">Figure 9g</a>) and add two sensors in the black box (<a href="#Deploy_example_50x50">Figure 9h</a>). It still satisfies the threshold. In addition, we can save, photograph, or record a video of the improved result to do additional research, such as writing a paper.

        <h3>Permutation Combinatorial Optimization Interface</h3>

        <p>
          In combinatorial optimization problems, solutions are often represented as permutations, as exemplified by the classic Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). In the TSP, a fixed number of cities are involved, each with its own distinct spatial coordinates. Consider a TSP instance with $n$ cities, wherein the objective is for the salesman to visit each city precisely once before returning to the starting point. The computational complexity of this problem increases factorially with the number of locations, posing a challenge in devising strategies to minimize time and cost. Evo-Panel 2.0 features a dedicated interface tailored for permutation optimization problems, specifically designed for addressing challenges like those posed by TSP. Our interface offers a comprehensive view of the entire route and evolutionary progression, alongside numerous functionalities such as zooming and pausing, facilitating in-depth analysis.

            <strong>Figure 10:</strong> The demonstration of a permutation problem in Evo-Panel 2.0. (a) The system displays the location; the x1- and x2-axis represent the coordinates according to the log file. One black point represents one location. The system draws the road color according to the distance. This picture shows the beginning of ACO solving Burma 14. (b) As the iteration increases, ACO finds a better solution, which path length is 7353. (c) In the later stages of ACO's evolutionary process, it discovers a route connecting all cities through a shorter path, resulting in cooler color representations (ranging from green to dark blue) for all paths. (d) At the end of ACO, it finds an optimal solution that all the path colors are close to blue. The path is the shortest solution in Burma 14, in which the fitness is 3505. (e) By disabling the “align grid line” and enabling the “path usage,” the system displays the path traversed by the metaheuristic. These functions can assist users in analyzing the metaheuristic's properties and trends. All gray roads are those that are being abandoned by ACO. (f) Increasing the magnification (zooming in) and moving closer to an unclear location in order to observe it more clearly. Here we can see both of these cities are located along the same x2-axis. In addition, clicking the location (city) can reveal additional information, such as the location's name and coordinates. (g) Users can return to the initial solution space at any preferred generation after the adjustment, which displays the overview paths. (h) The "detailed information" can display the exact path length for each path.

          Evo-Panel 2.0 can display the algorithmic process in permutation and linear problems. Taking TSP solving Burma 14 (one of TSP problems in the TSP library [<a href="#ref_37">37</a>]) as an example, the system draws the user-specified map, x1- and x2-axis coordinated positions, and every location on the map (<a href="#ACO_burma14">Figure 10a</a>). The system displays both the solution space and the algorithm's process in the middle. The black dot represents all the locations (cities) in Burma 14, which has 14 cities that the salesman must visit. When the algorithm begins, the system draws the road in a red-to-blue hue based on distance. The distance corresponds with the color bar on the right-hand side of the screen. The color is closer to red if the distance is longer and closer to blue if the distance is shorter. Evo-Panel 2.0 displays the changes in roads as the number of iterations increases (from <a href="#ACO_burma14">Figure 10a</a> to <a href="#ACO_burma14">Figure 10d</a>). Researchers can easily determine whether the metaheuristic changed the path or which shortest road was found by the metaheuristic. At the beginning of ant colony optimization (ACO), some roads are red or orange because the metaheuristic has not yet discovered shorter paths. As the metaheuristic continues, the red line decreases (<a href="#ACO_burma14">Figure 10b</a>). When the evolutionary process goes to the post-period, as depicted in <a href="#ACO_burma14">Figure 10c</a>, most roads are green, which means the metaheuristic found an optimal path. At the end of the evolutionary process (<a href="#ACO_burma14">Figure 10d</a>), metaheuristics find the shortest path in Burma 14.

          After outlining the ACO process, we proceed to introduce several functionalities within the permutation interface. In <a href="#ACO_burma14">Figure 10e</a>, we deactivate the “aligned grid line” while activating the "path usage" feature to enhance graph visibility. The "aligned grid line" serves as an auxiliary guide for city alignment, while the “path usage” function provides insights into road alterations. By comparing current and prior paths, it enables an analysis of metaheuristic trends. The varying shades of gray denote the recency of road usage, allowing users to discern the most recently traversed routes. Lighter shades indicate older generations, whereas darker shades signify more recent generations. In <a href="#ACO_burma14">Figure 10e</a>, the track fades and becomes whiter with the time of metaheuristic not go, indicating that the ant's pheromone volatilizes over time. Researchers can analyze if the metaheuristic expends computational time redundantly, thereby enabling the identification of areas with potential for enhancement. Besides, the interface in Evo-Panel 2.0 can be "zoomed in" and "moved" to the area of interest (<a href="#ACO_burma14">Figure 10f</a>) to analyze two nearby locations. “Zoom-in” and “zoom-out” allow users to analyze the solution space with greater detail and a broader perspective. If you move the mouse over a city, our visualization tool can display information about the city, including the city's name and the location of the x1 and x2 axes. When we move the mouse over these two nearby cities in <a href="#ACO_burma14">Figure 10f</a>, the system shows that their x2-axis coordinates are identical. After observing particular regions, we can “reset solution space” to quickly return to the initial solution space (<a href="#ACO_burma14">Figure 10g</a>). After adjusting the solution space through zooming in and out, it is simple to reset it with one click. In the end, we can view “detailed information” regarding the length of all paths (<a href="#ACO_burma14">Figure 10h</a>), allowing us to carefully examine each path and conduct additional research.

          Evo-Panel 2.0 serves as a valuable visual aid for analyzing a variety of algorithms and optimization problems across different user groups. It aids teachers in presenting algorithms and optimization problems more comprehensively, enables students to gain clarity on their functionality, and empowers researchers to deeply explore the connections between diverse algorithms and optimization problems. Consequently, guided by user feedback, we demonstrate the three practical applications of Evo-Panel 2.0 in real-world optimization scenarios. The first segment utilizes the global-best guided quantum-inspired tabu search with a quantum-not gate (GNQTS) [<a href="#ref_38">38</a>]-[<a href="#ref_39">39</a>] to resolve stock selection challenges. Subsequently, the second part replicates real-world placement dilemmas. Finally, the third part leverages maps of America and Europe to simulate practical travel-related issues. This demonstration highlights the broad versatility of Evo-Panel 2.0, showcasing its applicability across various algorithmic domains and optimization problems.

            <strong>Figure 11:</strong> Optimization process analysis of GNQTS in the stock selection problem. (a) The initial probability selected for stocks, set at half (0.5), is visually represented by the color green on the screen. (b) In the initial phase, with a probability close to $50\%$, stocks are randomly selected, resulting in a staggered pattern in the interface. (c) As the iteration advances, GNQTS progressively reduces the number of selected stocks to enhance returns and mitigate risks. (d) Users can display the names of stocks in each investment portfolio. (e) In the intermediate stage, GNQTS gravitates toward a superior portfolio while distancing itself from the inferior, resulting in a shift in probability's color towards orange and blue. (f) In the yellow box, GNQTS discovers a better portfolio in the $2945^{th}$ generation and uses the quantum-not gate to jump out of local optima. Therefore, the stock's color (probability) has changed from red to blue. (g) As the algorithm goes to the end, the color (probability) turns dark red and blue, and (h) the GNQTS converge to an optimal portfolio according to the chosen probability. (i) The convergence describes the varying fitness of the algorithm at various stages. The GNQTS continues to rise in the early stages and reaches its global maximum in the middle stage. Additionally, in the $2945^{th}$ generation, after the quantum-not gate operation, the fitness notably increased.

        <p>
          Evo-Panel 2.0 is a powerful analysis tool for benchmark functions as well as real-world applications of various combinatorial optimization problems. This subsection uses GNQTS to solve the stock selection problem as an example. The stock selection problem is a real-world application of a general combinatorial optimization problem. In this stock selection example, one bit corresponds to one stock. The combinatorial is composed of the NASDAQ 100 index of the U.S. stock market. The trend ratio [<a href="#ref_40">40</a>] guides the algorithm in its search for a portfolio with a high-return and low-risk profile.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          GNQTS is a probability-based metaheuristic for combinatorial optimization problems, which means it chooses stocks based on the probability of each stock. The guiding principle behind GNQTS involves the pursuit of favorable stocks while actively evading unfavorable ones. In the early stage, the chosen probability is set to half (0.5), and the color is around green in <a href="#GNQTS_example">Figure 11a</a>, so the portfolio in <a href="#GNQTS_example">Figure 11b</a> is staggered (the black and white colors are staggered).  As the iteration goes, <a href="#GNQTS_example">Figure 11c</a> selects fewer stocks than <a href="#GNQTS_example">Figure 11b</a>.  Additionally, the detailed information can assist users in observing and analyzing which stock was selected by metaheuristic. Here, <a href="#GNQTS_example">Figure 11c</a> depicts the portfolio from $181^{th}$ to $191^{th}$ generation. Corresponding to <a href="#GNQTS_example">Figure 11d</a>, the “detailed information” indicates which NASDAQ 100 stock is selected. As the research progresses to the intermediate stage (<a href="#GNQTS_example">Figure 11e</a>), the algorithm finds the trend and increases the probability of the best portfolio, so the probability starts moving to orange or light blue colors, even red or blue colors.
        </p>

        <p>
          In <a href="#GNQTS_example">Figure 11f</a>, a single stock is chosen by the global best portfolio, prompting GNQTS to utilize the quantum-not gate for navigating away from local optima (as depicted by the shift from blue to red within the yellow box). As the algorithm progresses towards completion (<a href="#GNQTS_example">Figure 11g</a>), the colors transition to dark blue or dark red. Consequently, as illustrated in the probability plot in <a href="#GNQTS_example">Figure 11g</a>, the algorithm discards stocks with a probability of 0 (shown in dark blue) while retaining favorable stocks with a chosen probability of 1 (depicted in dark red) in <a href="#GNQTS_example">Figure 11h</a>. The convergence curves in <a href="#GNQTS_example">Figure 11i</a> serve as a concise representation of the algorithm's performance, offering insights into the moments of discovering a promising portfolio and the overall trend during the quest for the optimal solution.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Through the use of the Evo-Panel to analyze algorithms for solving stock selection problems, researchers can acquire additional algorithmic insights from the visual interface. This includes evaluating whether the problem-solving process aligns with the designated methodology, tracking the evolution of the global best portfolio, and determining the convergence status of the algorithm, among other aspects. All this information contributes significantly to the effective refinement and enhancement of metaheuristics.

(c) By observing the connectivity of \ref{fig:Deploy_50x50fire_136}, the three major hotspots are interconnected. This solution appears to be the best, but further optimization is possible. Evo-Panel 2.0 visualizes the results, enabling users to optimize the outcomes achieved by the metaheuristics, as depicted in Figs. (d) to (f).

        <p>
          As previously stated, the deployment problem can be used for many applications, including fire detection, surveillance camera monitoring, and base station communication. Real business deployment problems involve a variety of situations, which may require a different threshold for each position in order to meet a variety of situations. The threshold could be based on historical data such as the occurrence probability of fires, crimes, automobile accidents, traffic jams, etc. To handle a variety of situations, the map can be created with varying sizes, and each grid point can define the limit-detecting probability (threshold) individually.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the deployment optimization case study, we investigate the deployment optimization problem within the context of three specified hotspots as delineated in <a href="#Deploy_fire">Figure 12a</a>. Within these three hotspot regions, there is a notable demand for increased sensor, camera, or station density to achieve higher detection probability thresholds. This specific problem exhibits complexity beyond the uniform threshold, more closely resembling real-world scenarios. The outcomes obtained by employing Entanglement-QTS to address this three-hotspot problem are evident in <a href="#Deploy_fire">Figure 12b</a>, mirroring the pattern observed in <a href="#Deploy_fire">Figure 12a</a>. Both <a href="#Deploy_fire">Figure 12a</a> and <a href="#Deploy_fire">Figure 12b</a> manifest areas with dense concentrations of three sensors, signifying the algorithm's success in optimizing the deployment based on threshold considerations.
        </p>

        <p>
          The subsequent analysis pertains to connectivity, a pivotal aspect aimed at augmenting communication and information interchange among sensors, thereby fostering a more cohesive and efficient system. <a href="#Deploy_fire">Figure 12c</a> delineates the interlinkages derived from <a href="#Deploy_fire">Figure 12b</a> across five distances. Through Evo-Panel 2.0 analysis, it becomes apparent that the three hotspot areas exhibit high interconnections, whereas the sensors in the lower-left region operate independently, lacking interlinkages. This observation underscores the stable connectivity within the hotspot regions, suggesting room for further optimization of connectivity in the lower-left quadrant by the algorithm.
        </p>

        <p>
          Furthermore, upon scrutiny, it is discernible that each white box within <a href="#Deploy_fire">Figure 12d</a> encompasses a pair of closely situated sensors. Employing an interactive feature within the Evo-Panel 2.0 interface, we systematically eliminate one sensor from each white box, as depicted in <a href="#Deploy_fire">Figure 12d</a>. Subsequent scrutiny, as portrayed in <a href="#Deploy_fire">Figure 12e</a>, demonstrates consistent adherence to the prescribed detection threshold across all grid points. Notably, closer examination reveals a marginal elevation in detection probability within the enclosed black area situated in the lower-left corner of <a href="#Deploy_fire">Figure 12e</a>. Strategically reconfiguring the setup by replacing three sensors from <a href="#Deploy_fire">Figure 12e</a> with two sensors effectively aligns with the specified threshold criteria, as elucidated in <a href="#Deploy_fire">Figure 12f</a>. This final configuration reflects a reduction of three sensors while ensuring compliance with the detection probability threshold, validated by the "Complete" status indicated by the map checker tool.

        <h3>Arrangement Optimization Interface</h3>
        
        <p>
          In recent years, a well-developed network and the COVID-19 pandemic have contributed to the widespread adoption of online platforms for ordering food or groceries, such as food delivery and online shopping platforms. To deliver goods to consumers as soon as possible while minimizing costs, the delivery company needs to plan the shortest route possible. Therefore, finding the quickest route in real-world TSP applications is greatly regarded by businesses and consumers. However, the complexity of the TSP problem increases factorially with n location. The computer has its limitations and cannot quickly find the optimal solution. Through the visualization tool Evo-Panel 2.0, users can intuitively analyze the results of metaheuristics. With the interactive function, users can further improve the algorithm's output or generate their own path to minimize costs.

          Evo-Panel 2.0 is an interactive visualization tool as well. We provide an interactive function that enables users to connect or modify the line to create or enhance a path. The user could start with an empty map (<a href="#Arrange_att48">Figure 13a</a>) or the result of metaheuristics (<a href="#Arrange_att48">Figure 13b</a>) to solve the TSP problem of att48 [<a href="#ref_37">37</a>], which is 48 capitals of the US. Users can begin "recording" in either <a href="#Arrange_att48">Figure 13a</a> or <a href="#Arrange_att48">Figure 13b</a> to record the change process. If users begin with an empty map similar to <a href="#Arrange_att48">Figure 13a</a>, they could connect each city/capital one by one and return to the starting city. If users begin with the result of the metaheuristic shown in <a href="#Arrange_att48">Figure 13b</a>, they can delete the road connection and reconnect new roads whatever they want. The improved final result is depicted in <a href="#Arrange_att48">Figure 13c</a>, which represents the shortest path for this problem [<a href="#ref_37">37</a>]. Once the process is completed, we can stop recording, take a picture, and save the improved result (<a href="#Arrange_att48">Figure 13d</a>). Furthermore, researchers can use the results to conduct additional research, create reports, and compose papers.
