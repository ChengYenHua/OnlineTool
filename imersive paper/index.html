        <h2>I. Introduction</h2>

        <p>
          Optimization problems can generally be categorized into two types: numerical optimization problems, which involve continuous real-valued variables, and combinatorial optimization problems, which deal with discrete decision variables such as selection (e.g., choose or not choose) or permutations. Regardless of the type, the primary objective remains the same: to minimize costs while maximizing overall benefits.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the business industry, a wide variety of optimization problems are encountered, ranging from well-known combinatorial problems like the 0/1 knapsack problem and the traveling salesman problem (TSP), to more domain-specific applications such as the wireless sensor network deployment [<a href="#ref_4">4</a>], stock selection problem [<a href="#ref_2">2</a>] and circuit synthesis problem. These problems often involve complex decision-making under constraints.
        </p>

            <figcaption style="text-align: left;"><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Exponential growth of combinatorial possibilities in stock selection. The figure illustrates how the number of combinations expands rapidly with the number of available stocks. Even a moderate increase from three to fifty stocks results in an astronomical growth in possible selections, highlighting the phenomenon of combinatorial explosion. </figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>

        <p>
          Take the problem of stock selection as an example, as show in Figure 1. When considering three stocks, each stock can either be selected or not selected, resulting in $2^3 = 8$ possible combinations which ranging from selecting none (000) to selecting all (111). With four stocks, the number of combinations increases to $2^4 = 16$. However, as the number of stocks increases to fifty, the number of possible combinations explodes to $2^{50}$, which exceeds one quadrillion. This exponential growth in complexity renders exhaustive search computationally infeasible within a reasonable timeframe. This makes such problems ideal candidates for advanced optimization techniques, such as metaheuristic algorithms, which are specifically designed to efficiently explore large and complex solution spaces.
        </p>

        <p>
          Metaheuristic algorithms, such as genetic algorithm (GA)[<a href="#ref_6">6</a>], particle swarm optimization (PSO)[<a href="#ref_7">7</a>], ant colony optimization (ACO)[<a href="#ref_8">8</a>], estimation of the distribution algorithm (EDA)[<a href="#ref_9">9</a>], quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm (QEA)[<a href="#ref_10">10</a>], and quantum-inspired tabu search algorithm (QTS)[<a href="#ref_11">11</a>], are widely applied to address complex real-world optimization problems. Most metaheuristic algorithms are population-based and iterative in nature. By adapting encoding strategies and problem representations, they can be tailored to solve a variety of problem types and are capable of finding near-optimal solutions within a finite amount of time.

        <p>
          In numerical optimization problems, researchers often evaluate the performance of metaheuristic algorithms using challenging and highly complex mathematical functions. As illustrated in Figure 2, benchmark functions, such as Schwefel, Michalewicz, and Ackley, are intentionally designed to be deceptive, multi-modal, and difficult to optimize. In many cases, the mathematical expressions of these functions are so complex and unintuitive that forming a mental image of their landscapes is difficult. Moreover, in business and industrial contexts, the objective functions are often entirely unknown and treated as black boxes, making it virtually impossible to predict their mathematical form or landscape.

        <p>
          Traditional approaches for analyzing algorithmic performance are illustrated in Figure 3. In earlier studies, researchers typically analyzed the behavior and performance of optimization algorithms through text-based interfaces such as command-line environments, terminal consoles, or the traditional DOS interface, often referred to as the "black window". These environments displayed the optimization process step by step in real time. Alternatively, results were frequently exported to Excel files or other spreadsheet software, where additional analysis could be conducted using log files and manual interpretation.

          </div>
        </div>

        <p>
          However, analyzing particle movement through command-line outputs often requires manually checking and comparing particle coordinates across iterations.Even with a relatively small setup, such as 100 generations with 20 particles each, this results in 2,000 data points quickly become difficult to analyze, as shown in Figure 4. Determining the direction of movement for each particle becomes time-consuming, unintuitive, and practically infeasible.
        </p>

        <p>
          To address this challenge, this paper developed a dynamic visualization system that graphically presents the optimization process in real time. While the previous example illustrates the issue in numerical optimization, similar challenges also occur in combinatorial optimization problems, where the solution space is discrete and exponentially large, making the analysis of search behavior even more difficult. Therefore, this study focuses on developing an interactive visualization interface specifically designed for combinatorial optimization, enabling users to observe and interpret the algorithm’s decision process more intuitively. By facilitating a clearer understanding of how candidate solutions evolve and interact, the interface not only enhances analytical insight but also supports more effective algorithm evaluation, comparison, and improvement.

        <h2>III. Proposed Visualization Tool</h2>
        <p>
          Within the domain of business, there are a multitude of optimization challenges that require resolution. Prior to resolving optimization challenges specific to the industry, researchers typically evaluate optimization algorithms using benchmark functions. Enhancing the efficacy of an optimization algorithm on benchmark functions increases the probability that it will successfully tackle optimization functions that are specific to a given industry. In this section, we use three benchmark problems to introduce how the system works on the three interfaces, including GA and QTS solving the 0/1 knapsack problem in the general combinatorial optimization interface, Entanglement-QTS [<a href="#ref_35">35</a>] solving the deployment optimization problem in the deployment combinatorial optimization interface, and ACO solving TSP in the permutation/linear combinatorial optimization interface.
        </p>

        <h3>General Combinatorial Optimization Interface</h3>

        <p>
          In the general combinatorial optimization interface (general interface), all kinds of chosen or not combinatorial optimization problems can be displayed through this interface. Evo-Panel 2.0 can show the fitness, all item combinations in each generation, and items' detailed information so that users can check if the metaheuristic matches their thoughts or problems' constraints.

          In the combinatorial optimization visualization mode, black grids represent selected items, while white grids represent unselected items. Each horizontal row corresponds to a single generation, with the generation index displayed on the left and the corresponding fitness value on the right. The bottom-most red row indicates the global best solution found throughout the evolutionary process.
        </p>

        <p>
          In this example, the visualization demonstrates the application of a genetic algorithm to solve the 0/1 knapsack problem. Initially, item selections are made randomly, resulting in a mixed pattern of black and white grids. As the algorithm evolves, it performs selection, crossover, and mutation based on the fitness values of the parents, gradually guiding the population toward higher-quality solutions.

          To facilitate the demonstration, we configured the items’ cost-performance (C/P) ratios such that items on the left have higher values while those on the right have lower values. As the algorithm progresses into later generations, we can observe that the black grids—representing selected items—gradually concentrate on the left side, indicating that the algorithm is effectively learning to favor items with higher cost-efficiency.

              Visualization of selection probabilities in a probabilistic optimization model.

        </div>

        <p>
          In addition to binary selection (0 or 1), some algorithms incorporate probabilistic decision-making mechanisms. For example, several algorithms determine item selection based on probability values rather than fixed binary choices. By clicking the "Probability" button in the interface, users can visualize each particle’s probability using a color gradient ranging from red to blue.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the early stages of evolution, the grid appears predominantly green, indicating a probability of 0.5, where the likelihood of selecting or not selecting an item is equal. As the generations progress, the colors gradually shift—probabilities increase toward 1 (red) or decrease toward 0 (blue), reflecting the algorithm's increasing certainty in its selections. Redder grids indicate stronger selection preference, while bluer grids suggest a stronger tendency to exclude.
        </p>

        <p>
          A notable observation is the presence of distinct vertical blue stripes within red-dominated regions, indicating that the algorithm has learned to consistently exclude certain high C/P items on the left. This behavior occurs in order to satisfy the knapsack's capacity constraint, choosing instead lower C/P items from the right to construct a feasible yet optimal combination. This phenomenon exemplifies the inherent complexity of the 0/1 knapsack problem, highlighting its NP-complete nature and the nuanced trade-offs involved in combinatorial decision-making—which are precisely what make the problem both extremely challenging and intellectually intriguing.

        <p>
          One key advantage of the probability model is its ability to expose non-obvious behavioral shifts during the algorithm’s progression. <a href="#Prob_reversal">Figure 8</a> presents a case observed through the interface, where a bit's probability flips from below 0.3 to above 0.7, marking a decisive change in the algorithm’s behavior. This reversal may indicate that the algorithm has escaped a local optimum, shifting toward a new search region. Such turning points, which are difficult to capture from numerical data alone, become immediately apparent through color transitions in the probability matrix.

        <p>
          This section presents a visualization interface designed for analyzing permutation-based optimization problems, using the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) as an example. This interface allows users to observe how the algorithm searches for the optimal route through dynamic path visualization. For demonstration purposes, we utilize classic benchmark data from the TSP Library, which provides a variety of well-known problem instances.
        </p>

        <p>
          In this case, we selected the burma14 instance for ease of observation. The system plots a map of 14 cities in Myanmar, and the evolving routes are displayed with a color gradient representing path length—red for longer paths and blue for shorter ones. Through this visualization, users can clearly observe the algorithm’s progress, and in this instance, it has already converged to the shortest known path for the problem.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, as the number of cities increases, the solution space grows factorially, significantly increasing the complexity of the problem. To further engage users and provide an intuitive understanding of the algorithm’s behavior in such complex cases, we have also developed an interactive game mode interface in addition to the analysis mode.

Travel costs are shown on the right, and path colors provide visual cues, with blue indicating efficient routes and red representing less favorable ones. Certain paths may be blocked due to constraints, encouraging users to revise their choices to complete all required connections.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Upon selecting the Taiwan map, the interface begins by allowing users to connect cities. As connections are made, the system displays the travel cost—for example, from Taitung to Kaohsiung—on the right side of the screen. To facilitate intuitive observation, the connecting lines are color-coded based on distance or cost: red indicates a longer or more expensive route, while blue represents a shorter or more economical one. If a high-cost route is chosen and appears in red, users are encouraged to reconsider and select a more efficient path.
        </p>

        <p>
          In addition, the system simulates real-world traffic constraints. For instance, a landslide between Nantou and Hualien may prevent direct travel, mirroring real-life industrial scenarios involving constraint-based optimization. These features not only enhance the realism of the problem but also increase the game's engagement and educational value. Once the user successfully completes all the connections within the given constraints, the system displays a "Good job" message.

        <p>
          As the number of cities increases—such as in the United States or Europe map—the problem quickly escalates into a highly complex optimization task. By leveraging the power of the crowd, the interactive game interface not only enhances user engagement but also contributes to the discovery of high-quality or even optimal solutions. The more participants engage with the game, the more collective effort is directed toward solving the problem, effectively transforming gameplay into a form of distributed research collaboration.

          The last interface focuses on deployment-based optimization, commonly encountered in scenarios involving large-scale public events, such as New Year’s Eve concerts or political rallies. In such situations, a critical question arises: How many mobile base stations are needed, and where should they be placed to ensure adequate communication quality for all attendees? In <a href="#sensor-deployment-panel">Figure 12</a>, black squares indicate the positions of deployed base stations (or sensors), while the color gradient from red to blue represents varying levels of detection or signal coverage probability.
        </p>

        <p>
          For example, on a 5×5 grid, a single sensor can sufficiently satisfy the monitoring requirements. On a 10×10 grid, only four sensors are required. However, when the grid size increases to 20×20—which is 16 times larger in area—one might assume that 16 sensors are necessary. In reality, the overall coverage probability is determined by subtracting the probability that a given point is not detected by any sensor from 1:

          where $\mathcal{P}_p$ represents the overall detection probability of grid $p$, $P_p^s$ denotes the probability that sensor $s$ detects grid $p$, and $V_p$ is the set of all sensors capable of detecting grid $p$. For instance, when a grid is monitored by two or more sensors, its detection probability increases—visually transitioning from blue to green on the map. As a result, only 12 sensors are required to satisfy the coverage conditions for the entire grid.

          When the grid size increases to 50×50, the problem complexity escalates to $2^{2500}$ possible combinations, making exhaustive search computationally infeasible. In such cases, optimization algorithms become essential for identifying high-quality solutions within a reasonable time. In previous studies, international researchers successfully submitted a solution using 63 sensors to the IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC). Later, a more refined solution using only 62 sensors was accepted and published in the journal Computer Networks, demonstrating the effectiveness of algorithmic approaches in tackling such large-scale deployment problems.

            <strong>Figure 14:</strong> An illustration of a deployment problem in Evo-Panel 2.0. (a) In the early stage of the Entanglement-QTS search, this map is almost red due to the sensor's high density and extensive overlap. (b) In the middle stage, the number of sensors decreases, and some positions display a green color detection probability. (c) At the end of Entanglement-QTS, Evo-Panel 2.0 shows that the entire color of all positions is mostly green, indicating that Entanglement-QTS reduces the cost of the sensor and finds an optimal solution for 62 sensors. (d) Evo-Panel 2.0 shows a demonstration of the connectivity of sensors within a distance of five. (e) Utilizing Evo-Panel 2.0, users have the capacity to manually refine the algorithm's optimal solution. By removing a sensor within the white box, a successful reduction in sensor count is achieved while maintaining adherence to the constraints. (f) Observing <a href="#Deploy_example_50x50">Figure 9f</a>, we identified overcrowding in the black box, prompting the removal of three sensors, resulting in an incomplete map check. (g) Afterward, two sensors were placed within the black box to fulfill the threshold requirement across the entire map, marking the map check status as "complete" once more. Evo-Panel 2.0 enabled users to save data with the final optimized result.

          However, analyzing such results through traditional text-based outputs or log files is often difficult and unintuitive. By leveraging a visualization interface designed in the form of an interactive game, users can easily identify potential improvements. For instance, it becomes visually apparent that one sensor in the lower-left corner can be removed, and in the densely covered central area, three sensors can be replaced with two, effectively reducing the total number of sensors to 61 or even 60, while still satisfying the overall coverage probability across the entire map.
        </p>

          This approach highlights the potential of crowdsourced computation, where individuals without formal research training—but with strong problem-solving intuition through gameplay—can contribute to discovering improved solutions and assist researchers in addressing complex optimization challenges.
