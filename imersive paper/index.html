        <h2>I. Introduction</h2>

        <p>
          Optimization problems can generally be categorized into two types: numerical optimization problems, which involve continuous real-valued variables, and combinatorial optimization problems, which deal with discrete decision variables such as binary selections (e.g., inclusion or exclusion of an element) or permutations. Regardless of the type, the primary objective remains the same: to achieve an optimal trade-off between competing objectives, such as minimizing cost and maximizing profit.
        </p>

        <p>
          In various real-world domains, optimization problems across different application areas and levels of complexity are frequently encountered, including the 0/1 knapsack problem [<a href="#ref_1">1</a>] and the traveling salesman problem (TSP) [<a href="#ref_2">2</a>], to more domain-specific applications such as the wireless sensor network deployment [<a href="#ref_3">3</a>], stock selection problem [<a href="#ref_4">4</a>] and circuit synthesis problem [<a href="#ref_5">5</a>]. These problems often involve complex decision-making under constraints.
        </p>

            <figcaption style="text-align: left;"><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Exponential growth of combinatorial possibilities in stock selection. The figure illustrates how the number of combinations expands rapidly with the number of available stocks. Even a moderate increase from three to fifty stocks, results in an astronomical growth in possible selections, highlighting the phenomenon of combinatorial explosion. </figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>

        <p>
          Take the problem of stock selection as an example, as shown in Figure 1. When considering three stocks, each stock can either be selected or not, resulting in $2^3 = 8$ possible combinations ranging from selecting none (000) to selecting all (111). With four stocks, the number of combinations increases to $2^4 = 16$. However, as the number of stocks increases to fifty, the number of possible combinations explodes to $2^{50}$, which exceeds one quadrillion. This exponential growth in complexity renders exhaustive search computationally infeasible within a reasonable timeframe. This makes such problems ideal candidates for advanced optimization techniques, such as metaheuristic algorithms, which are specifically designed to efficiently explore large and complex solution spaces.
        </p>

        <p>
          Metaheuristic algorithms, such as genetic algorithm (GA)[<a href="#ref_6">6</a>], particle swarm optimization (PSO)[<a href="#ref_7">7</a>], ant colony optimization (ACO)[<a href="#ref_8">8</a>], estimation of the distribution algorithm (EDA)[<a href="#ref_9">9</a>], quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm (QEA)[<a href="#ref_10">10</a>], and quantum-inspired tabu search algorithm (QTS)[<a href="#ref_11">11</a>], are widely applied to address complex real-world optimization problems. Most metaheuristic algorithms are population-based and operate iteratively to progressively improve candidate solutions. By adapting encoding strategies and problem formulations, they can be tailored to solve a variety of problem types and are capable of finding near-optimal solutions within a finite amount of time.

        <p>
          In numerical optimization problems, researchers often evaluate the performance of metaheuristic algorithms using challenging and highly complex mathematical functions. As illustrated in Figure 2, benchmark functions, such as Schwefel, Michalewicz, and Ackley, are intentionally designed to be deceptive, multi-modal, and difficult to optimize. In many cases, the mathematical expressions of these functions are so complex and unintuitive that forming a mental image of their landscapes is difficult. Moreover, in business and industrial contexts, the objective functions are often entirely unknown and treated as black boxes, making it virtually impossible to predict their mathematical form or landscape.

        </figure>

        <p>
          Traditional approaches for analyzing algorithmic performance are illustrated in Figure 3. In earlier studies, researchers typically analyzed the behavior and performance of optimization algorithms through text-based log files such as command-line environments, terminal consoles, or the traditional DOS interface, often referred to as the "black window". These environments displayed the optimization process step by step in real time. Alternatively, results were frequently exported to Excel files or other spreadsheet software, where additional analysis could be conducted using log files and manual interpretation.

              A full video showing the text-based output of an optimization algorithm, where each generation includes the coordinates and fitness values of multiple particles. As the number of generations and particles increases, interpreting such outputs becomes visually overwhelming and analytically inefficient, emphasizing the need for more intuitive visualization tools.
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>
          However, analyzing particle movement through command-line outputs often requires manually checking and comparing particle coordinates across iterations. Even with a relatively small experimental setup, such as 100 generations with 20 particles each, this results in 2,000 data points that become difficult to analyze, as shown in Figure 4. Determining the direction of movement for each particle is time-consuming, unintuitive, and practically infeasible.
        </p>

        <p>
          To address this challenge, we developed a dynamic visualization tool, Evo-Panel2.0, that graphically presents the optimization process in real time. While the previous example illustrates the issue in numerical optimization, similar challenges also occur in combinatorial optimization problems, where the solution space is discrete and exponentially large, making the analysis of search behavior even more difficult. This aligns with the growing need for explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) [<a href="#ref_12">12</a>, <a href="#ref_13">13</a>, <a href="#ref_14">14</a>], which emphasizes transparency in algorithmic decision processes. Therefore, this study focuses on developing an interactive visualization interface specifically designed for combinatorial optimization, enabling users to observe and interpret the algorithm's decision process more intuitively. By providing a clearer view of how candidate solutions evolve and interact, the interface enhances analytical insight and facilitates more effective algorithm evaluation, comparison, and improvement.

        <h2>II. Proposed Visualization Tool</h2>
        <p>
          Visualization plays a crucial role in helping users interpret complex data from a fresh perspective and understand optimization results more intuitively. As the saying goes, "A picture is worth a thousand words," and graphic representations remain one of the most fundamental cognitive tools developed by the human mind [<a href="#ref_15">15</a>]. This section presents Evo-Panel 2.0, a unified visualization tool designed to make the behavior of metaheuristic algorithms more interpretable and interactive. The tool provides real-time graphical feedback that transforms complex numerical results into intuitive visual representations, allowing users to observe how candidate solutions evolve and interact during the search process. The visualization tool includes three specialized interfaces, each targeting a specific type of combinatorial optimization problem. The following subsections describe these interfaces in detail, highlighting their functions and visualization benefits.

          As illustrated in Figure 5, the combinatorial optimization visualization mode displays each candidate solution as a row of grid, where black cells represent selected items and white cells denote unselected items. Each horizontal row corresponds to one generation, with the generation index shown on the left and the associated fitness value on the right. The bottom red row under the "View Generation" highlights the global best solution identified during the evolutionary process. In the early stage of evolution, item selections appear random, but after the genetic algorithm performs selection, crossover, and mutation, the population gradually converges toward higher-quality solutions.

        <p>
          As shown in Figure 6, the demonstration configures the items in descending order of cost-performance (CP) ratio, so that items on the left have higher value-to-weight efficiency compared to items on the right. This arrangement makes it easier to observe the algorithm's learning behavior. As illustrated during the later stages of evolution in Figure 5, the black cells represent the selected items, tend to accumulate toward the left side, indicating that the algorithm progressively learns to favor items with higher CP ratio. This visual progression, visualized by Evo-Panel 2.0, allows users to intuitively track how the algorithm adjusts its preference toward more cost-effective items.

              Visualization of selection probabilities in the Probability Model. A color gradient from red to blue represents the likelihood of item selection, enabling users to track how the algorithm gradually shifts from randomness to confident selection decisions across generations.

        </div>

        <p>
          In addition to binary selection (0 or 1), some algorithms incorporate probabilistic decision-making mechanisms, such as QEA [<a href="#ref_10">10</a>], quantum-inspired differential evolution (QDE) [<a href="#ref_16">16</a>], QTS [<a href="#ref_11">11</a>], and quantum-inspired binary PSO [<a href="#ref_17">17</a>]. These algorithms determine item selection based on probability values rather than fixed binary choices. In the Probability Model interface, users can visualize each particle's probability using a color gradient ranging from red to blue.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the early stages of the evolutionary process shown in Figure 7, the grid appears predominantly green, indicating a probability of 0.5, where the likelihood of selecting or not selecting an item is equal. As the generations progress, the colors gradually shift, with probabilities increasing toward 1 (red) or decreasing toward 0 (blue), reflecting the algorithm's growing certainty in its selections. Redder grids indicate a stronger selection preference, whereas bluer grids suggest a stronger tendency to exclude.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the later stages of the algorithm, a notable observation is the presence of distinct vertical blue stripes within the regions that are predominantly red yet correspond to relatively high CP values, indicating that the algorithm has learned to consistently exclude certain high C/P items on the left. This behavior occurs in order to satisfy the knapsack's capacity constraint, leading to the choice of lower C/P items from the right to construct a feasible yet optimal combination. This phenomenon exemplifies the inherent complexity of the 0/1 knapsack problem and highlights its NP-complete nature. The nuanced trade-offs in combinatorial decision-making make the problem both challenging and intellectually intriguing.

        <p>
          To further highlight the interpretability of the probability model, Figure 8 presents a representative case that reveals behavioral changes not easily captured from text log files. In this example, a bit's probability flips from below 0.3 to above 0.7 across generation from 1488 to 1489, marking a decisive change in the algorithm's behavior. This reversal may indicate that the algorithm has escaped a local optimum and shifted toward a new search region. Such turning points are difficult to capture from numerical data alone but are instead made immediately apparent through color transitions in our visualization tool.

              This visualization illustrates the optimization process for the Burma14 instance in the TSP using the ACO algorithm. The interface dynamically presents the evolution of routes across generations, with distinct colors indicating ranked path lengths, including red, orange, green, and blue representing the longest to shortest paths, respectively.

          This section presents a visualization interface designed for analyzing permutation-based optimization problems, using the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) as an example. This interface allows users to observe how the algorithm searches for the optimal route through dynamic path visualization. For demonstration purposes, we utilize classic benchmark data from the TSP Library [<a href="#ref_18">18</a>], Burma 14, which provides a variety of well-known problem instances.

        <p>
          Evo-Panel 2.0 plots a map of 14 cities in Myanmar, as shown in Figure 9, the evolving routes are displayed with a color gradient representing path length, red for longer paths and blue for shorter ones. Through this visualization, users can easily observe the algorithm’s progress, which in this case has converged to the shortest known path.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, as the number of cities increases, the solution space grows factorially, significantly increasing the complexity of the problem. To further engage users and provide an intuitive understanding of the algorithm's behavior in such complex cases, we have also developed an interactive game mode interface alongside the analysis mode.

Travel costs are shown on the right, and the colors of the paths serve as visual cues, with blue indicating efficient routes and red representing less favorable ones. Certain paths may be blocked due to constraints, encouraging users to adjust their selections in order to complete all required connections.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Upon selecting the Taiwan map, the interface allows users to connect cities. As connections are made, the system displays the travel cost, for example, from Taitung to Kaohsiung, on the right side of the screen is 78.58. To facilitate intuitive observation, the connecting lines are colored based on distance or cost: red indicates a longer or more expensive route, while blue represents a shorter or more economical one. If a high-cost route is chosen and appears in red, users are encouraged to reconsider and select a more efficient path.
        </p>

        <p>
          In addition, the system simulates real-world traffic constraints. For instance, a landslide between Nantou and Hualien may prevent direct travel, mirroring real-life industrial scenarios involving constraint-based optimization. These features not only enhance the realism of the problem but also increase the game's engagement and educational value. When the user successfully completes all the connections within the given constraints, the system displays a "Good job" message.

          As the number of cities increases, such as in the United States or Europe map, the problem quickly escalates into a highly complex optimization task. By leveraging the power of the crowd, the interactive game interface not only enhances user engagement but also contributes to the discovery of high-quality or even optimal solutions. The more participants engage with the game, the more collective effort is directed toward solving the problem, effectively transforming gameplay into a form of distributed research collaboration.

        <p>
          For example, on a 5 &times; 5 grid, a single sensor can sufficiently satisfy the monitoring requirements. On a 10 &times; 10 grid, only four sensors are required. However, when the grid size increases to 20 &times; 20, which is 16 times larger in area, one might assume that 16 sensors are necessary. In reality, the overall coverage probability is determined by 1 minus the probability that a given point is not detected by any sensor, as detailed in the related distance-probabilistic detection model [<a href="#ref_19">19</a>]:
        </p>

        <div class="equation">
          <div class="formula">
            $$\mathcal{P}_p = 1 - \prod_{s \in V_p} \left(1 - P_p^s \right)$$
          </div>
          <div class="number">(1)</div>
        </div>

        <p>
          where $\mathcal{P}_p$ represents the overall detection probability of grid point $p$, $P_p^s$ denotes the probability that sensor $s$ detects grid point $p$, and $V_p$ is the set of all sensors capable of detecting grid point $p$. For instance, when a grid point is monitored by two or more sensors, its detection probability increases, visually transitioning from blue to green on the map. As a result, only 12 sensors are required to satisfy the coverage conditions for the entire grid.

              Evo-Panel 2.0 Deployment Optimization Interface on a 50 × 50 grid displaying the near-optimal solution of 62 sensors found by the Entanglement-QTS algorithm. The interface allows users to manually analyze and refine this solution by adding or removing sensors. The color gradient indicates the overall detection probability (red/high to blue/low), while the objective remains to maintain a 100% coverage rate with the minimum sensors.

        <p>
         In Fig. 13, Evo-Panel 2.0 offers two visualization examples, Self-Optimize and Sensor Deployment Process Demo, each designed to support intuitive understanding of the deployment optimization problem.
         In the Self-Optimize mode, the interface initially presents one of the near-optimal deployment solutions generated by the Entanglement-QTS algorithm [<a href="#ref_20">20</a>]. Users may interact directly with the interface by adding or removing sensors, thereby refining the layout while referencing the color gradient map that indicates the overall detection probability (red/high to blue/low). This interactive configuration significantly enhances user engagement and provides an intuitive means for exploring how sensor placement affects overall coverage performance.
        </p>

        <p>
         The Sensor Deployment Process Demo mode can visualize the evolutionary search trajectory. It illustrates how a population of candidate solutions transitions from random initialization to convergence. Throughout the process, Evo-Panel 2.0 makes it straightforward to observe changes in sensor count, positional adjustments, and convergence behaviors, even within large-scale solution spaces. For instance, when the grid size expands to 50 &times; 50, the problem complexity escalates to 2<sup>2,500</sup> possible combinations, rendering exhaustive search infeasible. In such cases, advanced optimization algorithms are indispensable for identifying high-quality solutions within practical time constraints. Notably, prior work reported a competitive solution using 63 sensors, submitted to the IEEE International Conference on Communications. Later, a more refined solution using only 62 sensors was accepted and published in the journal Computer Networks [<a href="#ref_21">21</a>], demonstrating the effectiveness of algorithmic approaches in tackling such large-scale deployment, underscoring the difficulty and significance of achieving efficient coverage in large-area sensor-deployment scenarios.

            <strong>Figure 14:</strong> Human-assisted improvement of solution generated deployment optimization algorithm. This animated GIF illustrates a case study where a user manually refines an algorithm-derived, near-optimal solution (e.g., the 62-sensor configuration on the 50 × 50 grid). By analyzing the visualized coverage map, the user identifies and corrects instances of sensor redundancy. This interactive process successfully reduces the total sensor count, while maintaining the 100% coverage constraint (Map Check compliance). This demonstrates the tool’s usefulness for refining and validating solutions after algorithmic optimization.

        <p>
          However, analyzing such results through traditional text-based outputs or log files is often difficult and unintuitive. By leveraging a visualization interface designed in the form of an interactive game, users can easily identify potential improvements. For instance, Fig. 14 clearly reveals that one sensor in the lower-left corner can be removed, and in the densely covered central area, three sensors can be replaced with two, effectively reducing the total number of sensors to 61 or even 60, while still satisfying the overall coverage probability across the entire map.
        </p>

        <p>
          This observation underscores the potential of user-assisted optimization, demonstrating that individuals without formal research training but with strong problem-solving intuition developed through gameplay can help identify improved solutions and support researchers in tackling complex optimization challenges.

        <h2>III. Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
         Evo-Panel 2.0 provides a dynamic visualization tool designed to support the analysis of metaheuristic algorithms in combinatorial optimization problems. 
         
         First, it replaces extensive textual log data with vivid interactive and dynamic visual representations, which fundamentally improves the interpretability of algorithmic outputs and expedites the analytical process. This visual approach enhances users' comprehension of complex metaheuristic concepts and optimization processes.
         
         Second, Evo-Panel 2.0 offers versatile interfaces catering to distinct characteristics of combinatorial optimization problems: a general combinatorial optimization interface for binary problems, a permutation combinatorial optimization interface for sequential solutions, and a deployment optimization interface for solutions with strong spatial dependencies. It also incorporates a probability model tailored for probabilistic metaheuristics.

         Third, our visualization tool offers robust interactive features, such as media player control bars for in-depth algorithmic observation and the direct manipulation of solutions within the deployment interface, which facilitates the human-assisted refinement of metaheuristic solutions.

         Furthermore, Evo-Panel 2.0 is compatible with a wide range of metaheuristics and optimization frameworks and does not require specialized programming expertise to generate analytical outputs, highlighting its practicality and broad applicability for researchers employing diverse optimization approaches.

         Crucially, by offering a transparent view into the algorithmic search trajectory and decision logic, Evo-Panel 2.0 significantly advances the goals of XAI, enhancing the interpretability of computational intelligence models.

         By presenting algorithmic behavior in an intuitive visual form, Evo-Panel 2.0 assists researchers and developers in effectively evaluating and refining metaheuristic strategies.
